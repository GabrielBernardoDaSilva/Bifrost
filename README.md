## Overview

Bifrost ECS Engine is a lightweight Entity-Component-System (ECS) framework designed for game development and simulation in Rust. It provides a flexible architecture for managing entities, their attributes (components), and behavior (systems), allowing for efficient and scalable game development.

The ECS architecture separates concerns by representing entities as a collection of components and processing them using systems. Bifrost ECS Engine leverages this paradigm to offer high performance, easy extensibility, and a clean separation of concerns within game development projects.

## Features

- **Entity-Component-System Structure**: Bifrost implements the ECS architecture, enhancing modularity and scalability in game development projects.
- **Efficient Entity Management**: Provides a streamlined approach for creating, managing, and destroying entities, optimizing resource usage.
- **Component-based Design**: Allows developers to define and attach components to entities, encapsulating specific functionalities or properties.
- **Flexible System Execution**: Enables the creation of systems that process entities based on their components, facilitating behavior implementation.
- **Scalable and Performant**: Designed to handle large numbers of entities and components efficiently, ensuring smooth performance in games and simulations.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use Bifrost ECS Engine in your Rust project, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bifrost-ecs = "0.1.0"
